<meta name="description" content="Exascale Workflows Community: A Post-ECP Roadmap for Workflow Systems and Applications 2023 ECP Annual Meeting BoF Thursday - Jan 19, 2023 1:30pm-2:15pm CST Founders 3+4 Complex workflows have increasingly high computational and I/O demand and are composed of many communicating orchestrators, services, and simulations. The ECP ecosystem has observed an increasing pervasiveness of workflow systems to handle these classes of complex, distributed applications. The interplay of workflow technologies and HPC has been challenged by the fast rise of ML technologies: ML needs to be integrated within workflows to ease their development and portability; workflows must benefit from ML to scale and increase efficiency of executions; HPC must embrace workflows to democratize access to its resources, as workflow systems should better exploit the power of HPC systems; ML must adapt to HCP architectures to scale to real-world large settings, and HCP must adjust to ML requirements to provide the required computational resources to scale up to extremely large data sets. Furthermore, HPC resource allocation policies and scheduler designs typically provide a simple &quot;job&quot; abstraction instead of workflow-aware abstractions. As a result, it is difficult to run exascale workflows efficiently and conveniently on HPC systems without extending resource management/scheduling approaches. In this BoF, we will bring together researchers and DOE facility representatives from the workflows, HPC, and AI/ML communities that work on scientific research questions requiring large-scale, distributed, and AI-heavy computing at exascale as well as workflows that allow the integration of (physical) experiments and computational facilities. The session will discuss challenges, opportunities, and future pathways, and will seek input for a post-ECP community roadmap focused on the sustainability of HPC and AI workflows software and applications." />

            Complex workflows have increasingly high computational and I/O demand and are composed of many communicating
            orchestrators, services, and simulations. The ECP ecosystem has observed an increasing pervasiveness of
            workflow
            systems to handle these classes of complex, distributed applications. The interplay of workflow technologies
            and
            HPC has been challenged by the fast rise of ML technologies: ML needs to be integrated within workflows to
            ease
            their development and portability; workflows must benefit from ML to scale and increase efficiency of
            executions; HPC must embrace workflows to democratize access to its resources, as workflow systems should
            better
            exploit the power of HPC systems; ML must adapt to HCP architectures to scale to real-world large settings,
            and
            HCP must adjust to ML requirements to provide the required computational resources to scale up to extremely
            large data sets. Furthermore, HPC resource allocation policies and scheduler designs typically provide a
            simple
            "job" abstraction instead of workflow-aware abstractions. As a result, it is difficult to run exascale
            workflows
            efficiently and conveniently on HPC systems without extending resource management/scheduling approaches. In
            this
            BoF, we will bring together researchers and DOE facility representatives from the workflows, HPC, and AI/ML
            communities that work on scientific research questions requiring large-scale, distributed, and AI-heavy
            computing at exascale as well as workflows that allow the integration of (physical) experiments and
            computational facilities. The session will discuss challenges, opportunities, and future pathways, and will
            seek
            input for a post-ECP community roadmap focused on the sustainability of HPC and AI workflows software and
            applications.
        </p>

        <p>Specifically, the BoF session discussions will focus on the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the era of exascale and ML/AI, what are the emerging and future crucial challenges for post-ECP
                workflows?</li>
            <li>Considering workflows sustainability, what are the key constraints and opportunities to attain
                sustainability?</li>
            <li>Which software/technology are essential for enabling sustainable workflows post-ECP?</li>

                <li>(1) Support for diverse coupling of HPC and AI/ML components, and integration scenarios without
                    wholesale refactoring of applications. Flexible frameworks that enable a range are needed.

                    engine designs is an interesting question</li>
                <li>Difficulty providimg infrastructure for workflows that require dependable realtime turnaround</li>
                <li>Interconnection of systems; Standardized APIs; Data management</li>
                <li>One issue is that training data is often generated by physics models. These models take a lot more
                    time
                    and resources than a typical ML model for either training or inference. So there is a “length scale”
                    problem.</li>
                <li>Reproducibility - retain how and where the code was run (environment, parameters, configuration,
                    dependencies, etc)</li>
                <li>Dealing with heterogeneity of compute; Analysis of performance; Finding the shortest path to a
                    solution;
                    Reproducibility of workflows; Policy driven behavior vs technology behaviors</li>

        <strong>Considering workflows sustainability, what are the key constraints and opportunities to attain
            sustainability?</strong>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
                <li>Funding specific software vs applications vs workflows</li>
                <li>If we can not have a unified funding stream for sustainability, we should encourage agencies and
                    program
                    managers to encourage participation and collaboration in common software infrastructures and
                    processes.
                </li>
                <li>Building blocks that existing and future developers can use to customize/extend/ develop their own
                    workflow capabilities.</li>
                <li>A cognizant and consistent workforce that understands the workflow</li>
                <li>Reaching critical mass</li>
                <li>Workflows that cross institutional or organizational domains of ownership/control. We need policies
                    and
                    support from DOE</li>
                <li>Future funding</li>
                <li>Availability of no-code or low-code tools for defining and managing a workflow that lowers the
                    barrier
                    of leveraging workflows.</li>
                <li>The key opportunity is to create a wealth of knowledge and reusable capabilities. With a critical
                    mass
                    of workflows, I foresee a path to autonomous AI/ML-driven exploration of scientific questions. One
                    constraint is that we need to think about how sustain workflows at scale, at a population-level.
                </li>
                <li>Opportunities - containerized and cloud technology for resilience</li>
                <li>Standardized formats; Portability</li>
                <li>If workflows are complicated enough then managing the decencies becomes a challenge. You need to
                    test
                    all the interdependencies to ensure that the whole workflow keeps working.</li>
                <li>Opportunity: define benchmarks around workflows (and hope this benchmark lives like linpack did);
                    Constraint: to some extent a workflow with science is often something that is implemented to
                    something
                    for the first time ( never done before experiment) the tools required for production workflows vs
                    experimental workflows are not the same</li>
            </ul>

        <strong>Which software/technology are essential for enabling sustainable workflows post-ECP?</strong>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
                <li>Workflow systems and data management systems</li>
                <li>Cloud and classic-HPC interoperability and portability</li>
                <li>Depends upon workflow applications; in addition to application kernels, it includes libraries,
                    workflow
                    and resource management middleware, automation capabilities, data management software etc.</li>
                <li>Containers</li>
                <li>Collaboration. far more important than point solutions.</li>
                <li>Containers; Standardized apis and interface with a clear governance model</li>
                <li>Automated builds, tools like containers and space</li>
                <li>Package manager, build tools, Python, resource manager, GUI/CLI/API</li>
                <li>There's a need for cyberinfrastructures to enable the curation and maintenance of workflows, and
                    policies for governance for workflows as an enduring institutional resource. There is ongoing work
                    at
                    Sandia on this front.</li>
                <li>Containers, cloud-like services, systems with failovers or ability to burst to cloud</li>
                <li>Support for Resource/Workload Managers; Workflow-aware schedulers</li>
                <li>Ultimately it would be nice if the scale could be flexible. Some steps may need only a couple of
                    nodes
                    others could use thousands. To avoid wasting resources it would be nice if different phases could
                    use
                    different resource allocations.</li>
