The Workflows and Distributed Computing group at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center aims to carry out research on programming models for distributed computing. More specifically, this group will be contributing to the COLMENA project (Spanish funded project) which contributes to the definition of next-generation computing and data technologies by proposing a framework to ease the programming, deployment and maintenance of hyper-distributed applications on the device-edge-cloud Continuum.The group will have a significant effort devoted to the definition of the COLMENA programming model and its software platform.The new programming model environment will be inspired on organic colonies: collections of autonomous individuals with heterogeneous characteristics that cooperate forming different social organizations. In this new approach, each smart device (IoT sensor/actuators, network access point/router or Edge/Cloud server) composing a cyber-infrastructure is considered as an Autonomous ageNT (ANT) aware of its own IT capabilities (data processing power, storage capacity, sensors and actuators equipped, available network interfaces, etc.) and context (geo-location, owner, etc.). In such an environment, services will be described as a society with different roles. Each role is defined by behaviour (program logic), the necessary software dependencies and the hardware requirements to play it. The role composition of such a society will be defined by a set of rules that indicate the number of players of each role. ANTs autonomously pick one or more roles to play according to its characteristics, the requirements of each role and the current role distribution. Upon their decision, they contextualize themselves downloading the necessary software and start the execution.At any point, the infrastructure may change; a new ANT can join in or leave the Colony, the service may be in a peak or valley workload moment, or a network service may be disrupted. To rapidly adapt to these changes, ANTs constantly revisit their roles and consider any possible reconfiguration that may improve the service. The goal of the project is to develop a platform to create, deploy and operate services on the device-edge-cloud continuum. A programming framework capable of reducing the complexity of programming swarms. The “roles” will be programmable through simple, high-level programming interfaces, where no low level details are exposed. The project will also develop the necessary libraries and layers to support such an interface.For this research, the group is looking for an postdoc to contribute in this research, with the desgin and implementation of the COLMENA programming model and software platform.

      "title"       : "Workflows Education:  Underlying  Computer Science Concepts",
      "url"         : "/stories/2022/05/16/workflow-education/",
      "description" : "Workflow applications have become mainstream in many domains, including most of the sciences, engineering, as well as AI. It is thus crucial that educational and training opportunities be available to help grow an effective workflow workforce. Several institutions have already developed and made available training material for particular workflow systems, so that users can learn how to deploy and execute their workflow applications on hardware platforms on which these systems are installed. Less developed, but no less crucial, are pedagogic materials that target the fundamental concepts necessary to understand workflow applications and reason about their executions and the performance thereof. One of the reasons why these pedagogic materials are less developed is that many of the relevant concepts belong to “standard” parallel and distributed computing (PDC) topics, and it is assumed that these topics are already covered in university computer science curricula.This assumption is problematic for several reasons. First, it is well recognized that PDC is not sufficiently included in undergraduate computer science curricula, which has motivated the establishment of the NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed Computing. Although progress is being made, many computer science college graduates still do not have sufficient, or any, PDC exposure. Second, many potential members of the workflow workforce will not be computer science graduates. Third, even if students have been taught the relevant concepts at different times throughout their education, they may not have retained them effectively. There is a thus need for a one-stop, self-contained ``these are the concepts needed for being able understand and reason about workflow executions” pedagogic package. This content of this package should draw from multiple sources, and should be curated and vetted by the Workflow Community Initiative. Its main use would be to provide “prerequisite concepts you need to know for workflows” to students (as a complement to or a component of university courses, before starting a workflow-related internship, before engaging on graduate-level workflow-related projects, etc.) and professionals (e.g., before beginning to use workflows, to better understand workflow behavior and performance in various professional contexts).NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed Computing.A project that could provide useful components to include in this envisioned pedagogic package is EduWRENCH. EduWRENCH provides many pedagogic modules, each one including a pedagogic narrative, practice questions, open questions, and in-the-browser simulation-driven activities. Basic EduWRENCH modules target fundamental concepts of computation, I/O, and networking and explain how they drive application performance. Some modules focus on principles of parallel computation on multi-core machines, including notions of parallelism, speedup, efficiency, overhead, and load balancing. Other modules focus on principles of distributed computation over a network, including notions of data proximity. Several more advanced build on the aforementioned modules to teach workflow concepts and/or to use workflows as case-studies for more advanced topics such as scheduling, energy efficiency, etc. Most EduWRENCH modules have already been used effectively not only in university courses, but also to train beginning graduate students who are about to join a workflow research and development group. EduWRENCH by no means provides a comprehensive pedagogic package for workflows, but it may serve as a good starting point for the Workflow Community Initiative to define what such a package should and should not contain.EduWRENCH website.",

      "url"         : "/stories/2022/09/28/nextflow/",
      "description" : "Workflow management systems are as diverse as the business and scientific processes they support – from engineering to research to process automation. This article describes Nextflow – an open-source workflow manager widely used in life sciences. It covers the motivations behind Nextflow, explains what it is, and describes what the future holds for the platform.Background and MotivationsLike similar open source efforts, Nextflow was born out of a need to solve specific problems while I was working as a research engineer in the Comparative Bioinformatics labs at the Centre for Genomics Regulation (CRG). Researchers were struggling with several issues that are all likely too familiar to workflows community members – complex, buggy scripts, long-running workflows that would suddenly fail, and challenges monitoring, managing, and maintaining workflows.While there were several available workflow managers at the time, none of them specifically addressed our requirement. A fundamental challenge in the lab at that time was data handling. Comparative bioinformatics involves studying genome and protein sequences across species, and population-level studies can involve massive amounts of data. We needed a simple yet powerful framework to deploy the executions of thousands of tasks, comparing different alignment methods and protein sequences each other.Some Key Ideas Behind NextflowNextflow was designed from scratch having clear in mind key ideas and best practices:  Allow developers to reuse any existing piece of software without the need of intermediate interface or wrapper; the tool command line is the interface and Linux is the integration layer.  Manage tasks as a functional and self-contained unit of work. This was a key requirement to enable the deployment across heterogeneous computing platforms and allow auto-retry execution policy on failure.  Provides a high-level abstraction for tasks parallelisation that allows developers to write simple yet high-scalable application, without the need to struggle with low level problem such as race conditions  and locks to access shared resources.  Strongly decouple the scientific application logic from the configuration &amp;amp; deployment setting, in order to streamline the deployment across different platforms and enable the migration to cloud environments.  Remove unnecessary dependencies with external services and databases. We wanted a zero configuration experience both for the Nextflow runtime and the resulting pipelines.  Enable debugging and recovering of failed executions. Bioinformatics pipeline can spin the execution of tens of thousands tasks. If something breaks we need a strategy that would allow the debugging of the failed task independently of the rest of the pipeline, and make it possible to recover the computation once the problem was solved from the last successfully computed tasks, to avoid throwing away days of computing resources.Between these, very likely, the most important design choice that distinguishes Nextflow compared to other workflow management systems is the adoption of the data flow programming paradigm.We often imagine workflows as a sequence of steps designed from the top down and including various dependencies, decision points, and sub-flows. There is another way to envision workflows, however, and that is from the perspective of the individual process steps. Individual steps have no notion of the overall flow. They have an input, perform some processing, and write data to an output, typically another step in the workflow.Using this programming model you can think a workflow behaving like spreadsheet. In a spreadsheet, users enter expressions in cells that depend on calculations in other cells. The dependencies between cells can be complex, but users don’t think about how the spreadsheet will sequence calculations. Instead, they concentrate on the logic in each cell. When a cell changes, the spreadsheet worries about how to propagate changes to dependent cells. Nextflow is described as reactive because task execution is triggered when inputs change or become valid. It turns out that this model works surprisingly well at scale, and opportunities for parallelism occur naturally without the workflow designer needing to think about them.From a technical point of view, Nextflow processes (aka tasks) can be thought of as reactive agents which run  in parallel waiting for the input data that trigger their execution. It’s important to highlight that each of these processes are isolated from each other, and they can only communicate via asynchronous messages represented by dataflow variables.Along with these, another pillar component of Nextflow was the adoption of containers as a core feature of the framework. Nextflow abstracts away the containerisation of the pipeline execution in a declarative manner. This means the user is only required to specify the container that needs to be used to run specific workflow tasks. Nextflow takes care to use this information to run the task within the container depending on the target execution platform that can be, for example, AWS Batch, an HPC batch scheduler e.g. Slurm or a local computer. This choice was proven to be critical to enable the portability and reproducibility of the resulting data analysis workflow. Nextflow nowadays supports multiple container runtime technologies, including Docker, Podman, Singularity, Charliecloud among others.Nextflow TodayWhen Nextflow was launched as an open-source project in 2013, we couldn’t have imagined what it has become today. Today, Nextflow is downloaded over 55,000 times monthly and used by over 1,000 organizations, including some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms. Ideas like containers and support for source code managers (SCMs) are so thoroughly baked into Nextflow’s design that they seem commonplace.In Nextflow, we were careful to decouple workflow logic from the details of underlying computing environments. To achieve this, Nextflow supports an abstraction called an Executor. Executors are pluggable components that enable pipelines to run without modification across virtually any compute environment, from a local host to an on-prem HPC cluster to various cloud services. Shifting to a new compute environment is as simple as changing a few lines of code in a configuration file.Pipelines can be stored locally or pulled from a preferred SCM at runtime. While applications can still be installed locally, pulling containers encapsulating bioinformatics tools has become the norm. Nextflow handles all the details, including compute resources, data movement, and making datasets visible to containers at runtime. Intermediate results and data are also cached, making flows resilient and recoverable after a failed step.The nf-core CommunityThe nf-core community launched in 2018 marked a key milestone for the Nextflow community. nf-core is an independent effort to collect a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow. Significant effort has gone into developing tools, templates, and guidelines that enable domain experts to contribute to the community. The result is a set of high-quality pipelines that are portable, reproducible, fully documented, and cloud-ready. A recent State of the Workflow 2022 community survey showed that 62% of Nextflow users take advantage of these pipelines in their day-to-day research – a testament to their utility and the importance of this effort.Towards the FutureWe are fortunate to have vibrant user and developer communities actively engaged in Nextflow and helping to guide its evolution. We continue to support new computing environments, introduce new functionality, and improve throughput and scalability. I recently shared some plans for Nextflow in the article Evolution of the Nextflow runtime.We are also planning to further enhance the support for containers providing a better automation on the overall container management lifecycle and ease the provisioning of multi-containers required by modern data analysis pipelines.We are also improving our commercial Tower offering enabling improved collaboration, new data-related features, and features aimed at helping further optimize resource usage to reduce cloud spending.You can learn more about Nextflow or download it for free by visiting nextflow.io.

      "description" : "The European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) aims at developing a World Class Supercomputing Ecosystem in Europe and, with this goal, is procuring and deploying pre-exascale and petascale systems in Europe. These systems will be capable of running large and complex applications. In this sense, the demand from the application stakeholders includes not only aspects related to High-Performance Computing (HPC) but also artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics.The eFlows4HPC project has as objective to provide a software stack that makes easier the development of workflows that involve HPC, AI and data analytics components. The project aims to give support to dynamic workflows in the sense that the set of nodes in the graph of the workflow can change during its execution due to changes in the input data or context of the execution, and be reactive to events that may occur. The runtime systems supporting this execution should be able to perform efficient resource management, both in terms of time and energy.Another objective of the project is to provide mechanisms to make the use and reuse of HPC easier by wider communities. For this purpose, the HPC Workflows as a Service (HPCWaaS) methodology has been proposed. The goal is to provide methodologies and tools that enable sharing and reuse of existing workflows, and that assist when adapting workflow templates to create new workflow instances.eFlows4HPC software stack.The eFlows4HPC software stack includes components to develop the workflows at three levels: high-level topology of the workflows using extended TOSCA, required data transfers with the Data Logistic Pipelines and the computational aspects of the workflow with PyCOMPSs. Once a workflow has been developed, it is registered in the Workflow Registry. Similarly, the different components of the workflows, pre-trained AI models and data sets are registered in a set of catalogues and repositories. All these registries and catalogues are used by the HPCWaaS interface, which provides a REST API to deploy and execute the workflows. On execution, the stack also provides a set of runtime libraries to support the workflow execution and data management.HPCWaaS methodology.The eFlows4HPC developments are demonstrated in the project through three pillar applications in the areas of digital twins for manufacturing, climate modeling and prediction and urgent computing for natural hazards. Pillar I deals with the construction of digital twins for the prototyping of complex manufactured objects integrating state-of-the-art adaptive solvers with machine learning and data-mining, contributing to the Industry 4.0 vision. Pillar II develops innovative adaptive workflows for climate and for the study of tropical cyclones in the context of the CMIP6 experiment, including in-situ analytics. Pillar III explores the modelling of natural catastrophes – in particular, earthquakes and their associated tsunamis shortly after such an event is recorded.Coordinated by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), the eFlows4HPC consortium comprises 16 partners from seven different countries with expertise in technical aspects:  supercomputing and acceleration, workflow management and orchestration, machine learning, big data analytics, data management, and storage; together with expertise in the pillar workflows’ areas: manufacturing, climate, urgent computing.The initial results of the project are available under the project website in its deliverable section (see https://eflows4hpc.eu/deliverables/). The source code and documentation are publicly available as well (see https://github.com/eflows4hpc and https://eflows4hpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).",

      "url"         : "/stories/2022/10/24/covalent/",
      "description" : "Workflow orchestration is a common operations framework in the field of distributed computing.  As high performance computing (HPC) becomes more distributed and incorporates a greater degree of heterogeneous technologies, workflow orchestration will no doubt become a common practice in this space, as it has in adjacent spaces such as Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) and more recently in quantum computing. Users with repeatable sets of interdependent tasks (workflows) may wish to run them on a time-based schedule or, more commonly in research and development, they may wish to iterate on the design of one or more experimental workflows. This iteration can include different algorithms, different model hyperparameters, different compute backends, or even different compute frameworks entirely.  With these options, it is increasingly possible to construct and optimize workflows which span across multiple on-premises supercomputers, multiple clouds, and even emerging technologies such as quantum computers.While so many options are a delight to workflow architects, they pose real challenges for operations. How are credentials managed and conveyed across such systems?  How do researchers ensure workflow data pipelines are efficient and secure?  How are logical tasks broken apart and rejoined (“packed”) to optimize information transfer across physically distant systems?  When something fails, how easy is it to trace back errors across frameworks and to re-run portions of a workflow?  There are certainly many other such challenges that workflow practitioners are familiar with.Covalent unifies tasks written in different languages and with heterogeneous compute requirements.Covalent is Agnostiq’s answer to these challenges.  With roots in quantum computing applications, Agnostiq researchers quickly learned that the operational challenges in quantum research today consume the majority of a project’s time. Covalent was developed primarily to manage experiments and facilitate access to cloud compute resources for researchers with little or no cloud engineering background. Today, users can interact with a large variety of cloud resources – including Batch, Kubernetes, and Braket Hybrid Jobs – using Covalent’s AWS Plugins package.The release of a Slurm plugin further enabled our team to interact with partners’ supercomputing resources, in particular in federated or hybrid-cloud configurations. Such flexibility is increasingly in demand as scalability begins to hit a power-consumption barrier, and as more HPC vendors and users begin to incorporate cloud and other distributed compute platforms. As we realized these tools can benefit more than our organization, we decided to transform Covalent into a product in its own right, and to open-source the software on GitHub in January 2022.Covalent’s user interface enables users to easily visualize and interact with distributed workflows.Quantum computing, of course, introduces its own set of unique needs.  Firmly rooted as a heterogeneous technology from the outset, quantum computers today mainly run Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) algorithms which are variational, or hybrid, in nature.  These algorithms require classical and quantum resources working in tandem.  Whereas traditional HPC workflows often involve loosely coupled tasks spanning many hours or days in a single location, variational quantum workflows are tightly coupled, with timescales sometimes under a single second per task. Since classical and quantum resources may not necessarily be physically located in the same data center, most of the execution time may in fact arise due to data transfer and requeuing – often thousands of times per workflow.  A remedy to this requires collaboration among many parties in order to optimize the user experience and maximize hardware occupancy.  With Covalent at the center of this conversation, Agnostiq hopes to stimulate a new discussion around how we think about workflows in highly heterogeneous environments.Users and providers interested in learning more about Covalent can view the source code on GitHub, join the Covalent Slack channel, follow us on Twitter, or reach out to the team for more information at contact@agnostiq.ai.  We also welcome open-source contributions and discussions on GitHub.  If you like what we are up to, please show your support by starring our repository.",

      "title"       : "The Elephant in the Data Center – Energy Consumption of Workflow Executions",
      "url"         : "/stories/2023/01/13/elephant-in-the-data-center/",
      "description" : "The execution of scientific workflows consumes electric energy – and often quite a lot as workflow systems usually are employed especially for large data sets, complex analysis tasks, and distributed execution over sizeable compute clusters. While techniques to reduce this consumption have been researched for decades, they currently reach a new level of urgency, as energy costs skyrocket (at least in Europe) and the world more and more acknowledges that the era of low-cost energy production from carbon-heavy fuels will have to come to an end. Thus, it is high time for any workflow researcher and workflow user to ask herself – what can we do to save energy? The answer to this question has multiple facets.The classical response is “increasing efficiency of software and hardware”, and research in the past has almost exclusively focused on this idea. Efficiency in terms of energy can intuitively be understood as processing output per watt; increasing efficiency thus means producing more output for the same amount of energy or producing the same output at less energy (or, in an ideal world, both). Techniques typically focus on the latter, for instance by developing more energy-efficient algorithms (e.g. joule sort) or using more energy-efficient hardware (e.g. GPUs or FPGAs) for specific problems. More recently, the same idea is followed by works in machine learning, trying to achieve the same accuracy of predictions with much smaller models, which require less energy for training and application.However, from the perspective of a large data center, these approaches all too often fail to actually save energy, simply because a data center typically always runs at full load – no matter how many efficiency-enhancing tricks are applied. When codes get more efficient, a given analysis is finished in less time (thus requiring less energy), yet the freed time is typically not used to power down the cluster, but rather to run some other analysis that otherwise might not have been prioritized; in commercial clouds, such idle times are sold over the spot market. From a purely economic point of view, this historically made a lot of sense, as acquiring a cluster was much more expensive than running it (ignoring the cost of human administration which must be paid at a constant rate anyway), and thus all clusters should be used to their maximum degree to achieve a good return on investment. At this point we must notice the important difference between “increasing energy efficiency” and really “saving energy”: More efficient algorithms achieve the former but not the latter when the point of view is widened from a single workflow execution to a data center perspective.A similar effect can be observed with more energy-efficient hardware. Clearly, a data center built with modern low-energy chips can perform the same computation as one built with older high-energy chips at less energy, yet this effect is typically out-weighted by the trend that data centers simply become bigger and bigger and thus consume more energy again – an instance of Jevons Paradox. A similar effect exists with cars, where the average fuel consumption has been reduced only marginally over the last 20 years, despite the fact that more and more efficient engines were developed, simply because these are built into ever larger and heavier cars.The local perspective – developing individual workflowsNow – what can workflow research do to save energy and cost? From a single-workflow perspective, there are a few obvious measures along the line we just discussed. We can save energy by using more efficient codes and by running the workflow on more efficient hardware. We can save cost by energy-aware scheduling, i.e., running the workflow in times when energy is cheaper, thus exploiting price differences offered by the local energy provider; in the future (and partly already in the presence), it is quite conceivable that energy prices will become cheaper whenever it is produced in abundance, for instance by solar collectors on sunny or wind power plants on windy days, or when consumption is low, for instance at night and in summer. Even if such scheduling may not save lots of money, it would certainly help to reduce carbon emissions by trading “bad” energy for “better” energy.However, there are also less obvious measures for saving energy (and money), which revolve around the concept of “output” of a workflow. So far, we implicitly assumed that a workflow is a fixed set of computations turning some input data into a computational result. However, that is a very computer-science focused point of view – most users are much more interested in the scientific result than in the specific computation that was performed to produce it. This leads to the question whether we cannot have the same, or almost the same, scientific result with less computation? The answer very often is: Yes. One example was already mentioned before, i.e., the usage of smaller and thus lower-energy models in machine learning. However, in many types of analysis, many more ideas can be followed. For instance, classification or regression tasks often are evaluated in a k-fold cross-validation. The larger the k, the more energy is required, as k-fold cross-validation performs k rounds of training and testing. Thus, choosing smaller k’s typically saves energy; the price might be a less robust result. In NLP, training and fine-tuning in many tasks already have become so expensive that typical evaluations dropped the idea of cross-validation and use a single test partition instead; apparently, the “price” has been accepted by the community. Bootstrapping or Monte-Carlo-style analysis methods perform the same type of computations tens of thousands of times to achieve robust results; reducing the number of repetitions leads to a linear decrease in energy consumption, again at the cost of less robust results. Hyperparameter optimization also performs model training and evaluation repetitively with slightly different inputs (e.g. using grid search or Bayesian methods); again, reducing the number of runs leads to a linear decrease in energy consumption, at the peril of not finding a better parameterization and thus not having the best possible result. Iterative model improvements are pushed to their extremes in projects around AutoML, which often boil down to a hilarious number of trial and error computations with varying algorithms, input sets, hyperparameters, etc. Finally, sampling is a ubiquitous technique to reduce the computational cost of studying very large data sets; of course, smaller sample sizes also reduce energy costs. Note that none of these ideas leads to a provable “non-optimal” solution, but solutions typically improve (slightly) with more iterations or more samples; a workflow developer thus always has to decide at which point to stop. Probably, energy consumption should and will soon be a strong argument for stopping earlier; and the community should start accepting this argument when reviewing papers or project grants. An important start could be that we all start to report energy consumption figures with our analysis.The global perspective – data centers running multiple workflowsWhat can a data center do to save energy or reduce energy costs? The most obvious measure is to reduce services, for instance by switching off a cluster partly or entirely. This clearly is an extreme action that probably no data center manager will favor (unless forced to after comparing the electricity bills with the available funding); however, it will undoubtedly immediately save energy and energy costs at the same time. A less drastic and popular measure is to use DVFS techniques, which possibly leads to losing some performance, or to switch to more energy-efficient hardware. Especially the latter, however, again carries the danger that pressure is growing to invest the savings in energy in extensions of the cluster (see above), as long as the bill still can be paid, which will deprive the energy savings. Furthermore, one must not forget the resources necessary to build the hardware of the cluster; using existing hardware (and not replacing it) as long as feasible can actually be a proper means to save energy, even if a new generation of hardware might be more energy-efficient than the present one. Finding the sweet spot within this trade-off is the daily business of data center managers and currently shaken due to the changing proportions of costs for acquisition, maintenance, and operation.Another option is to put more effort into avoiding redundant computation across multiple workflows. In many fields of science, certain reference data sets exist that are used by many groups; examples in the life sciences are large genome data sets, e.g. The Cancer Genome Atlas, examples in remote sensing are series of images from satellites like LandSat; examples in astronomy are the images from large sky observations like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These data sets are typically published in a raw format, yet many downstream analyses require some form of pre-processing that is often very similar or even completely identical across multiple workflows. Performing such processing only once can save substantial energy, it requires either careful consultation of users or automatic means to identify identical computations across workflows; in a long-term vision, such pre-processing could even be shared across multiple data centers, not just multiple workflows. However, it must not be forgotten that keeping results for further access also costs energy (as long as it is not written to tape archives) to keep memory powered, SSDs responding, or disks spinning. Intelligent research data management and advanced workflow optimization thus can play an important role in saving energy.Putting it all together – turning every screwThe necessity for saving energy and energy cost is no longer a topic of the future or important only in small niches – it has become an urgent need for all of us now. This also affects workflow research and research performed with workflows, as executing workflows is particularly energy hungry. We discussed several approaches to these problems that differ in their focus (saving energy versus saving money) and their scope (individual workflows versus data centers). There are surely many more ideas than presented in this short commentary; we would be eager to learn about them, for instance by personal mail (leser@informatik.hu-berlin.de).From a 10,000-feet perspective, the approaches can all be considered variations of a common theme, extending the classical trade-off in high-performance computing (i.e., compute time versus compute costs) with a crucial third factor: energy consumption. We believe that this more complex landscape requires new lines of research in diverse areas such as scheduling, research data management, heterogeneous architecture, monitoring, and workflow optimization – now.",

      "description" : "Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been successfully applied to a wide variety of commercial applications.  However, adoption of ML in traditional high performance computing (HPC) applications has lagged other segments because of differences in software ecosystems and cluster management tools.  Specifically, these applications are typically written in Fortran, C, and C++ and leverage OpenMP and/or MPI parallelization to extract peak performance on HPC platforms. On the other hand, ML toolkits are generally Python-based. Moreover, HPC systems use advanced workload managers to schedule and manage bare-metal jobs.  The SmartSim library (https://craylabs.org) was developed by Cray and HPE to overcome these challenges and help users create novel HPC workflows that mesh modern data science with machine learning capabilities.SmartSim OverviewSmartSim is an open-source software package developed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) that helps users combine traditional engineering, scientific, and high-performance computing applications with machine learning tools and visualization packages.  Internally, SmartSim consists of two libraries: an infrastructure library and a client library. The infrastructure library’s API enables users to configure scientific applications and to define and launch experiments (potentially including ensembles of simulations).  As part of the machine learning infrastructure, SmartSim launches an in-memory database accessible across all applications in the workflow.  Machine learning models can be executed inside the database or data can be streamed out of it for visualization and training.  Machine learning infrastructure can be launched on CPU, GPU, or multi-GPU compute nodes, and the SmartSim library has features to help users achieve maximum workload throughput with all of these systems.  SmartSim supports launching user-described workflows on several HPC workload managers including Slurm, PBS, LSF, and Cobalt.  SmartSim also allows users to launch workflows locally on MacOS or Linux systems.The SmartSim client library, for its part, provides interfaces that can be embedded into any Fortran, C, C++, or Python application.  With these clients, applications can transfer data to and from the in-memory database and they can execute ML tasks (such as inference) on this data.  Also, because the database is accessible by all component applications in the workflow, data can be streamed into and out of the database for online analysis and ML model training.  Further, the client library offers optimized aggregation methods that retrieve data from the database for tasks such as online visualization and online training.  The SmartSim client library needs only a TCP/IP connection to communicate with the database so it is highly portable.Sample experiment showing a workflow with machine learning infrastructure launched by SmartSim and connected to online analysis and visualization via the in-memory database.SmartSim Usage Example: Embedding ML to Improve the Accuracy of Ocean ModelingWithin the oceanographic community, the behavior of the water in oceans is simulated via ocean general circulation models (OGCMs). OGCMs use the Navier-Stokes partial differential equations (PDEs) to represent the laws of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. Parameterizations added to these PDEs account for physical processes that occur at scales smaller than the model grid, but their unconstrained use can violate the conservation laws. Modern ocean modeling theory considers eddy energy (EKE) to be a critical variable in these parameterizations. The current state of the art numerically solves a PDE that describes EKE; however, the estimation or omission of a number of terms leads to significant errors. To improve the quality of OGCMs, collaborators from HPE, the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) used a data-driven approach with machine learning to replace the EKE PDE. SmartSim is the key technology that allowed this ML model to be meshed with existing OGCMs. As a result of these efforts, we were able to improve the simulation accuracy without impeding performance in large-scale climate simulations.In this work, we evaluated the results of our ML approach to the numerical approach using the Modular Ocean Model version 6 (MOM6). We compared the EKE estimated by each approach to the baseline EKE calculated by a third ‘eddy-resolving’ (ER) simulation with a spatial resolution of about 10 kilometers. This resolution is sufficient to resolve mesoscale eddies (turbulence) in the equator and mid-latitudes, but it is computationally expensive.  The other two configurations coarsen the spatial resolution to 25 kilometers, which places them into an ‘eddy-permitting’ regime where modeling the impact of eddies on the rest of the simulation requires turbulence parameterization. The coarser configurations differ only in their eddy parameterization models: one uses the Mesoscale Eddy Kinetic Energy (MEKE), which represents the current state-of-the-art.  The other uses “SmartSim-EKE”, which is based on a neural network trained to infer the eddy kinetic energy.In our demonstration, we used SmartSim’s ensemble capabilities to run 12 parallel SmartSim-EKE simulations thereby demonstrating the scalability and performance of SmartSim. In so doing we were able to evaluate the accuracy of EKE parameterizations, and estimate overall computational cost at scale. We computed each ensemble member for 10 simulated years on an aggregate total combining 10,920 Intel Skylake and Cascadelake processors cores along with 16 Nvidia P100 GPUs dedicated to the shared in-memory database.  Figure 2 summarizes the MOM6 ensemble workflow and the translation of SmartSim workflow descriptions to launched jobs on the hardware cluster.Summary of MOM6 workflow developed with SmartSim.We compare SmartSim-EKE and MEKE to the “true” EKE calculated from ER in the images below.  As shown in Figures 3 and 4 below, SmartSim-EKE tends to overestimate the extent of the equatorial (0 latitude) EKE, but otherwise provides a much more accurate predictions of large-scale trends compared to the MEKE state-of-the-art predictions.  Importantly, these gains in accuracy from the SmartSim-EKE ML model did not incur significant computational penalties relative to the state-of-the-art.  Specifically, we observed only a 1.5% slowdown in the simulation – negligible on modern systems with heterogenous compute nodes and higher GPU counts. These results show that machine learning infused into traditional HPC workloads can provide significant improvements in accuracy and/or performance.  Moreover, SmartSim enabled these ML-driven gains without extensive changes to the HPC application source code or requiring maintenance of a one-of-a-kind ML infrastructure.  More detailed information on the accuracy and performance of this SmartSim use case can be found in the Journal of Computational Science (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2022.101707).Eddy kinetic energy (EKE), averaged over the last year of each simulation, calculated from the most-accurate eddy-resolving (ER) simulation (a), inferred using SmartSim-EKE and averaged over all 12 ensemble members (b), and the current state-of-the-art MEKE parameterization (c).Zonally averaged EKE (on a log10 scale) as a function of latitude from the ER, SmartSim-EKE, and MEKE. Note that within 20 degrees of the equator MEKE computes a near-zero value for EKE.To stay up-to-date on new SmartSim features and release, please favorite (star) the SmartSim GitHub repository: https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim.",
